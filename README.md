This is the backend-for-frontend module of the "Software system for for young patient anxiety recognition in emergency care unit setting" thesis prototype

This backend requires to downlad and install an H2 database (https://www.h2database.com/html/download.html), which is used for storing consent ids, user credentials, and user feedback, when run locally

If in need of a production build, the latest one is kept in the target folder, including a jar file

To run the latest jar locally, having installed the H2 database, run "java -jar {jarFileName}"

The application will run on localhost:8080 by default
